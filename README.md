Hacktoberfest is great, but the issues are full of spam. This is a tool to classify issues to help find good ones to work on.

Issues are put in three categories:

* Good: Meaningful work on useful projects.
* Spam: Churn for Hacktoberfest T-Shirts. Empty repos, write fizzbuzz in 30 languages, meaningless junk.
* Novelty: Real, working projects with just for fun tasks. Participatory art, GPT3 poetry, Hacktoberfest stuff with real goals and engaged maintainers.
