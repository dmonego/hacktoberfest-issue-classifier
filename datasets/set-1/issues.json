If there are some empty values for the fields being filtered (Region, Topic, Type of Place, Speaker), the first choice in the second filter dropdown will be a blank option. Clicking this will crash Terrastories.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31662219/136296710-0b6c56ae-e766-4665-bd25-0d2a30c74423.png)\r\n\r\n2. If there are no values whatsoever set for the fields being filtered, the second filter dropdown will show one or several blank options; clicking these will crash Terrastories.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31662219/132909026-7479cbb5-2c49-4801-adfa-40d9a6efe344.png)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to Terrastories. \r\n2. Create (or log in to) a default community with some sample data.\r\n3. For some of the data, make sure that one of the filtered fields (Region, Type of Place, Topic, Speaker) is empty.\r\n3. On the map view, click on `Select Category` and chose the Filter for that field\r\n4. See error (as per screenshot) and if you click on the empty field, it crashes the app.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n1. If there are some (but not all) empty values for the fields being filtered, there should be no empty choice option at the very beginning. Instead, the stories/places without those values will just not be accessed through that filter.\r\n2. In the case of there not being any values set for one of the fields being filtered, instead of seeing a blank option, you would see a grayed out \"No Options\" message as you do when you click on the second dropdown without first having selected a category in the first dropdown.",

I've used the 'submit on enter' test for the `edit_channel_purpose_modal` component as a reference to solve this problem, simulating the enter event via wrapper.\r\n\r\n#### Ticket Link\r\n<!--\r\nIf this pull request addresses a Help Wanted ticket, please link the relevant GitHub issue, e.g.\r\n\r\n  Fixes https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/XXXXX\r\n\r\nOtherwise, link the JIRA ticket.\r\n-->\r\nFixes https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/17266\r\nJIRA: https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-34337\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n#### Related Pull Requests\r\nList all PRs related to resolving a ticket.

This is great, but depending on how it's done, it can harm compile times, and needlessly increase binary size.\r\n\r\nThere's a way to avoid these downsides and keep the nice API, which is to separate\r\nthe public API (with nice auto-conversions and such) from the implementation.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to convert these the methods in Context to follow this pattern.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor example, `new_context` is defined as so:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\n    pub async fn new_context<S: Into<Address>>(&self, addr: S) -> Result<Context> {\r\n        let addr = addr.into();\r\n        // actual work here...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould be transformed this version this one:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\n    pub async fn new_context<S: Into<Address>>(&self, addr: S) -> Result<Context> {\r\n        self.new_context_impl(addr.into()).await\r\n    }\r\n    async fn new_context_impl(&self, addr: Address) -> Result<()> {\r\n        // actual work here...\r\n    }\r\n```",
